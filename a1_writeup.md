# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

   Python is very confusing for me, at least for now because most of it's code has built in functions that I'm not used to learning. Because I took javascript last year, I got used to needing to write my own functions and having to reuse them for any little step, but with the built in functions, it's confusing. Also having the format of code makes it confusing to write code without asking AI for help, but it's slowly making sense because overall it's just code but in a different format.

3. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

   I don't have the exact prompt saved on this computer, but I used AI effectively by having it explain to me what's going on in step by step instructions. But an example of a prompt that I used was writing a for loop and conditionals in javacript, and asking AI to rewrite it in Pythons and explain the differences and why it works the way it works. From these responses, I am learning more about how the Python format works, which should help me be able to write more code in the future.

5. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

   The most confusing concepts were the built in functions, because I'm not used to them. As well as formating the code and there being so many ways to write the code, it was very confusing for me, and it still is, but I'm slowly understanding it. AI helped me understand by translating it into words that helps teach me best.

7. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

   I learned that AI is useful in terms of translating what information you know beforehand into new information which can be applied. I'm not sure if others do this, but this is how I use AI which helps me learn best. I would try a practice problem and write code, and if it doesn't work i would ask chatgpt to make my code work but in my format. If the code works and it makes sense logically, I understand it and try another problem with what I learned, but if I still don't understand why the code works, I ask ChatGPT to re-explain it in either javascript ter or do another example problem. The point is, if I get the answer and it makes sense as to why the answer is that, then that helps me learn.
