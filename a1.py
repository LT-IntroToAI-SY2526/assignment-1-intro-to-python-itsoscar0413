MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have experience with Javascript as i took APCSP and scored a 4, 
so I have a good understand of the basics of coding, but I don't understand anything about Pythons. Could you create 5 practice
problems that cover the basic foundations of Python, like basic stuff I should know?

Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..."

"""
PROBLEM 1: Problem 1: Hello, Input! Goal: Ask for user input and print a greeting.

Input: In Python, you use the input() function to get text typed by the user.

Storing input: Store what the user types in a variable, like name = input("What is your name? ").

Output: Use print() to display text on the screen.

String concatenation: Combine the greeting string and the name variable. In Python, you can do this using commas inside print() (which adds a space), or use string formatting.

Tip: Think about how you might do alert("Hello, " + name) in JavaScript â€” in Python, it's similar but with print().
"""

"""
Problem 2: Even or Odd Goal: Check if a number is even or odd.

Use input() to get the number as text.

Convert the input string to an integer with int().

Use the modulo operator % to find the remainder when dividing by 2.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.

Use if and else statements to decide what to print.
"""

"""
Problem 3: FizzBuzz Lite Goal: Loop through numbers 1 to 20, print special words for multiples of 3, 5, or both.

Use a for loop with range(1, 21) to get numbers from 1 to 20.

Use if statements and modulo % to check:

If divisible by 3 and 5 (both), print "FizzBuzz".

Else if divisible by 3, print "Fizz".

Else if divisible by 5, print "Buzz".

Else, print the number itself.

Remember the order of checking matters: check "both" first to avoid missing it.
"""
"""
Problem 4: List Sum Goal: Add all numbers in a list.

You already have a list, e.g., numbers = [2, 5, 8, 3, 1].

Create a variable to keep track of the total sum, starting at 0.

Use a for loop to go through each number in the list.

Add each number to the total sum.

After the loop, print the total sum.
"""
"""
Problem 10: Convert Temperature Goal: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Get Celsius from the user (convert input to float or int).

Apply the formula F = C * 9/5 + 32.

Print the Fahrenheit temperature.

"""
Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False
